# snipcart-theme-v2 | DMB FORK

This repository contains everything needed to generate a `snipcart.css` file used on Snipcart's v2.

However, it has been amended to work within the main website's site generator; fonts and images have been decoupled as well, CSS generation is handled by ([Hugo pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/)).

## Branches

The default branch for this fork is `dmb`. It will be used to compare with `master` (to sync with Snipcart's upstream repo).
